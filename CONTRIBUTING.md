# Contributing to Apache ComDev

We welcome participation in Apache Community Development (ComDev)
efforts! We just have a few tips, so that this doesn't devolve into
chaos.

## Getting Started

We hope to have better docs around everything as work proceeds. For the
moment, we ask that before you dig in, you join our [mailing list],
introduce yourself, and tell us what you want to work on. We might
already have something going in that direction, or have discussed how we
want to do something, so this will save you time and frustration.

## Contributing to Individual Working Groups

Each Working Group may have its own processes and nuances in how to
contribute. Please see their documentation in the subdirectories of this
repository, and, as always, join us on the [mailing list] for discussion
of your desired contributions.
