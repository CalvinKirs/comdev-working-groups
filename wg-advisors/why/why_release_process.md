# Release process

## Summary 

ASF project release software following a well defined process involving PMC members voting on release
candidates, publishing the artifacts in the ASF distribution system, and announcing the release to the
community.

## Why are we doing it?

We are doing it because this is what the ASF is doing. ASF delivers "Software for the public good"
and the act of releasing software is a key part of that. The process is designed to ensure that the
software is properly vetted and that the community is aware of the release and that the process of
releasing software is transparent, open and secure.

Releasing the software is a Legal Act of the Foundation and it has consequences for the Foundation
as software released by the Foundation is the main way the Foundation interacts with the public
and can be hold accountable for the software it releases.

Following the release process also provides Legal protection for the PMC and the release manager.

The release process is also aimed at ensuring that the software is properly vetted and tested and
that the development community is aware of the release and has had a chance to review and test the
release candidate. This is why it is an important aspect of the community building process to
engage the community in the release process and encourage them to vote as well.

## Is it mandatory and what are conditions?

The process is mandatory for all ASF projects.

## Are there variations for different projects?

There are certain variations of the process that the PMC can adopt, but they should
all be documented, and might involve the need of super-majority voting, release manager
casting and implicit +1, but there are few non-negotiable elements in the process (those
are mainly because of the legal protection they provide).

* PMC members must verify the release candidate for their provenance (licences, signatures,
  checksums, where applicable build reproducibility), and content (sources)
* At least three PMC members must vote +1 for the release candidate

There are many ways how the PMC can engage the community in the release and testing process
and the PMC should be encouraged to do so, some of the important aspects is to guide the community
what is changed in the upcoming release so that they can test what is changing, as well as
individually involving and engaging contributors who actually contributed to the release.

What also helps is to not to have too many release candidates, as any new candidate involves
a new round of voting and testing, so release manager should be encouraged to decide on
cancelling release candidates after giving sufficient time for the community to test
and flag potential issues.
