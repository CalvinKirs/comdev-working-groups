# Why this folder?

In ASF we have a number of rules, processes, policies which we follow that has been established over the
years. They are documented in various places and are not always easy to find. This folder is intended to
be a place where we can collect and curate these documents, and make them more easily accessible to
people who needs them among the advisors, but also to grab the current understanding on why we are doing
it in the first place, whether the policy is optional or mandatory, and what the consequences are if projects
don't follow them. In some cases we might introduce variations of the policies, or best practices, that
might depend on the size of the projects, stage they are in, stakeholder engagement and so on.

# Where the idea for the folder comes from?

This folder content is inspired by Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) which is a way to capture
short and comprehensive documents that describe a design decision, the context of the decision, and the
consequences of the decision. The idea is to have a record of the motivations behind the decision, and
the trade-offs that were considered. Similarly, we think that it is good to capture here the motivations
behind the policies, the trade-offs that were considered, and the consequences of the decision in ways
that are not documented in the policies, but are part of the understanding of the community, and sometimes
tribal knowledge. The idea behind keeping it here is to make it easier for the advisors to find the
information they need, and to make it easier to update the information when common understanding changes or
is better understood.

# What is in the content?

Those documents are not meant to copy the rules and policies. They are merely here to provide Advisor related
context, so that new advisors can understand the background and the reasoning behind the rules and policies
more easily but also to prevent advisors form spreading [cargo cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)
understanding of the rules and policies. We want to keep the following information in the documents in
similar chapters, to make it easier to build similar understanding of the rules and policies

* Rule or policy
* Very brief summary
* Links to relevant documents
* Why are we doing it?
* Is it mandatory and what are conditions?
* Are there variations for different projects?
