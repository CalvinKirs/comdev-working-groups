# Advisors Work Group (Proposed)

To provide "Advisors" - volunteers who come alongside a PMC to offer
an outsider's perspective on the project, and advice to build their
community.

## Status

This WG is in the STARTUP stage. No actual work has started, we're just
debating what that work might look like. Please come join the
conversation.

Meanwhile, there seems to be considerable objection to the name. The
ComDev list has been asked to decide on a better name.

## Who

An Advisor must be an ASF member. They are preferably a member who has
been around a while, and has some reason to be trusted as a mentor. You
must not already be a member of the PMC you wish to sharpen. You must 
not have any adversarial reason to take on the role - a bone to pick, 
a corporate entanglement, or whatever.

## What

An Advisor will subscribe to the project's mailing lists
and mostly listen. They will comment constructively when they see
something that may be improved or when they have useful suggestions
for the community.

There may be rare situations in which specific unaddressed concerns may
be [escalated](escalation.md) to the board.

See [use-cases](use-cases.md) for possible categories of
interest/involvement. See also [red-flags](red-flags.md) for common
signs of potential problems in a project.

## Values

Interactions by Advisors are at the pleasure of the PMC. You do not
have any authority over the PMC.

### Declinable

The PMC must be allowed to say "no thank you" without providing any
reason, and you must respect that decision, and not offer again unless
invited.

### Transparent

When you subscribe to the private@ list, you MUST introduce yourself and
state your purpose, complete with a link to THIS document. You MUST tell
the PMC when you intend to report something back to either ComDev or the
Board. You MAY announce yourself on the dev@ and other lists, a PMC 
member may introduce you, or you may just start participating.

We will also track, here, in this repository, which Advisor is
observing which project.

### Non-adversarial

All feedback must be a polite, positive, actionable suggestion, not
merely a criticism or a "you're doing it wrong." You must suggest what
the community should do, providing links to policy or best practice documents
where applicable. Simply criticising is not welcome.

If you cannot operate in this fashion, then this role isn't for you.

### Confidential

(No, this isn't a contradiction to Transparent. Different audiences.)

All communications on private@ mailing lists are confidential. Sharing
information you learned on those lists to anyone outside of the
membership of the ASF is a severe breach of trust.  Whenever possible,
discussion should be on public lists; but sensitive issues need to
remain confidential.

Do not ever cross-post between private lists with disjoint audiences. In
general, this means don't forward content from a private list to anyone
who is not an ASF member.

All reports on Advisors activity must be in <private> sections, unless
you have coordinated with the PMC to include it in *their* report.

### Collegial

You are a colleague - a peer. You are not in a position of authority.
You cannot tell the PMC what to do. You are only an observer, and, at
the indulgence of the PMC, advisor. Do not abuse this relationship.

## Bi-directional

Advisors are not just there to provide advice based on the best practices
and rules of the Foundation. They are also there to learn from the
project, and to bring back to ComDev and the Board the ways how many of
the projects apply the rules and best practices in their practices and
culture, taking into accounts individual project's needs and
circumstances. This might lead to updating and adjusting the common
understanding of the best practices and rules and how they apply in
various circumstances, bringing the useful feedback to the Board and
ComDev.

## Collaborative

Advisors are encouraged to share their experiences and exchange best
practices and ideas with each other, and to collaborate on the best ways to
help the projects and to transfer best practices and experiences of
the various PMCs between each other. They comdev mailing list and this
repository where "whys" and a little "hows" of the best practices and
rules are discussed and documented serve as as platform of this
collaboration.


## FAQ

## How to become an Advisor?

Just subscribe to dev@community.apache.org and add yourself to the
[list of advisors](advisors.md) in this repository and describe your
experience, skill and interests. Introduce yourself as a prospect
Advisor in the dev@community.apache.org mailing list.

### Why a member?

An Advisor must be an ASF member. This is because doing this job
requires access to a projects private@ PMC mailing list. All ASF members
already have this access.

Furthermore, an ASF member has already earned trust in the context of
the ASF. Trust is transitive - that is, you may not know all members
personally, but each member was nominated and elected by people that
you, in turn, nominated and elected.

### How to initiate PMC <-> Advisor relationship?

There is no real formal process for this. As an advisor, you may simply
start participating in the project's mailing lists (dev and/or private)
after introducing yourself and asking if this is fine for you to become
an Advisor.

The relationship is between the PMC and Advisor, no other offices are
involved except the Board letting the PMC know that they can have an
Advisor if they want one and the usual way Advisors or PMCs can reach
out to  other offices and groups (Trademarks, Legal, etc.) if they
need to  understand specific policies or procedures.

The PMC must be allowed to say "no thank you" without providing any
reason, and you must respect that decision, and not offer again unless
invited. The Advisor role is not a formal advised PMC role, it's a
ComDev role and the PMC is not obliged to have an Advisor.

You can also be invited by the PMC to become an Advisor. In this case
just add the PMC to the list of PMCs you advise.

### Board involvement wih Advisors

The ASF Board can also - during regular Board project review process -
identify a project that could benefit from an Advisor, and ask the PMC
to consider inviting an Advisor, and cc: dev@community.apache.org mailing 
list to make the advisors aware of such a project (which might also initiate
a voluntary Advisor to step up and offer their help). In general the PMC
should be allowed to decide whether they want an Advisor, and who that
Advisor could bem but if any Advisor is interested in a project, they
are encouraged to reach out to the PMC and offer their help.

In neither case, the Board is appointing an Advisor. The Board is only
asking the PMC to consider inviting an Advisor, and cc: the
dev@community.apache.org mailing list to give the opportunity for
the interested Advisors to step up and volunteer to help the project.

The side-effect of an Advisor being involved in a project is that it
might make it easier for the Board Members who review project
activity to understand the project's context and health by looking
at the discussions that the Advisor is involved in - hence the
list of [Advisors](advisors.md) in this repository can be a helpful
guideline for the Board Directors when they are reviewing project
reports.

### How to stop being an Advisor?

You may stop being an Advisor at any time. You should let the PMC know
on their list - usually with a `[NOTICE]` email. You do not need to
provide any reason for stepping down, however usually by that time
you will have built up a relationship with the PMC and it would be
polite to explain why you are stepping down. It's up to PMC if they
want to ask for another Advisor, also you might suggest another
Advisor to take over your role if you see a good fit among your peers
and you discussed it with them.
