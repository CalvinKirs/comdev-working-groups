# Website Working Group

This working group is an informal group of people who work on
maintaining, and improving, the [Apache Community Development
website](https://community.apache.org/).

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Long-term maintenance of the site. This involves regular audits, implementing metrics, and perhaps other things
* Reorg - this is a short-term task that I’ve been just doing on my own, which ensures it will never get done, and if it did, there may be some disagreement about how I did it.
* Deduplication - work closely with MarkPub to figure out the *right* place for certain information; work through the policy/best-practice dichotomy and ensure that we are *not* duplicating policy docs; Work on content on www.a.o <http://www.a.o/> that is closely related to content on community.a.o - which one is authoritative? Ensure that we don’t duplicate, contradict, or confuse.

See also the [proposal for the creation of this
group](https://lists.apache.org/thread/wj1prnm95cy0rlvjqgcq15rt2r28wyqg).

The ComDev website is generated from the [Github
repository](https://github.com/apache/comdev-site).
