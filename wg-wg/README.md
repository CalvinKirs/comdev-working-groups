# Working Groups Working Group

This working group exists to define how working groups should operate.

This is *NOT* intended to be any kind of top-down governance telling people
what they can or cannot do. Rather, it's hoped that if we create a
general structure for how to do these things, we'll encourage more
people to start work, without having to figure out how to organize that
work.

## Proposal

A working group is a small group of individuals who are in some level of
agreement about what work needs to be done around a particular topic.

Examples include:

* [Website WG](../wg-website/README.md) - Maintenance and improvement of https://community.apache.org/
* [Welcome WG](../wg-welcome/README.md) - Tools and process to welcome first-time contributors in a
  consistent and friendly fashion
* Communication WG - Tools and process around "internal" communication
  with projects at the ASF

etc.

## Membership

Anyone can volunteer to participate in a WG. They need not be an ASF
member, a committer on an Apache project, or any other criteria, other
than a willingness to discuss politely and work towards agreed-upon
goals.

A WG may maintain a public list of their membership.

## Communication

Each WG shall designate a place that they're going to keep in touch on a
regular basis, for some definition of "regular" that they agree upon.
They'll also maintain some kind of record of work in *this* repository,
so that newcomers can catch up on the discussion so far, and find their
place.

Email communications should happen on the main dev@community.apache.org
mailing list, and use a Subject line tag (eg [WG: Website]) to indicate
that the thread is related to that WG's work. In this way, the entire
community will be aware of the work that WGs are doing, without having
to subscribe to additional mailing lists.

## Values

ComDev workgroups are advisory only. ComDev is a peer project to all
other projects. ComDev does not have any authority over any other
project. All ComDev work may be declined by any project, without their
having to justify themselves.

You CANNOT tell another project what to do. You can only advise.

Where appropriate, you must communicate with other PMCs, committees, or
officers, who share some overlapping responsibility. For example, a
communications working group MUST coordinate with MarkPub, to not
overstep your authority.

## What we're working on

What we're working on is listed in [wip.md](wip.md). Come add your
ideas.
