# Membership

The WG has not yet established any formal membership, or criteria for
membership. It has been proposed that the WG-WG *must* have at least one
ComDev PMC member, since this group will be setting the process for all
other WGs.

The following people have expressed interest in participating in this
WG. (Please add your name, and, if desired, contact info, if you're
interested.)
