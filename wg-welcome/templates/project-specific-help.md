# Question about a specific project

## Question

Sometimes people post to dev@community with a question about a specific
Apache project. We are not the place for that question, and we need to
gently redirect, while offering a little additional information about
how the ASF works.

## Answer

Hi, _____, thanks for your interest in Apache.

As you may know, The ASF is home to more than 200 projects, and each
project has their own mailing lists, or other forums, for answering
questions. This list - dev@community.apache.org - is about building
communities across all these projects, but isn't usually the right place
for project-specific questions.

Your question is about the Apache [Foo] project, so the best place to seek
advice is at https://[foo].apache.org/ or on their project-specific
mailing lists at https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@[foo].apache.org

*** NOTE: Verify that the project in question has a users@ list, and
edit accordingly if they do not. ***

Good luck in your search for answers, and please do come back here if
you need additional help.
