# I want to contribute

## Question

Question usually looks something like "I want to contribute to an ASF
project" but doesn't contain a lot of detail about what their interests
or skills are.

"I'm new to open source and want to contribute to an Apache project. How
do I get started."

## Answer

Thank you for your interest in the Apache Software Foundation projects.

The ASF is home to more than 200 projects that span many topics,
programming languages, project sizes, code complexity, and other ways of
measuring. So where you get involved is going to vary based on your
interests.

* Projects by language: https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?language
* Projects by category: https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category
* Projects by size: https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?number
* Projects by name: https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?name

Most ASF projects conduct much of their discussion on a mailing list.
These lists can be found at https://lists.apache.org/ where you can read
the recent, and historical, discussions around the project. This might
give you an idea of whether a particular project is a good fit for you.

Most of our projects have their source code on GitHub, where you can see
what the open issues are, review pull requests, or contribute changes.

If you are interested in working on community building, that's what the
Community Development (ComDev) project is about. Our work is divided
into various working groups, which are listed on our website at
https://community.apache.org/working-groups/

We're a big organization, with a lot of projects, so if any of this is
overwhelming, please to ask your followup questions here, and we'll try
to guide you towards where you can best fit in.

Welcome!
