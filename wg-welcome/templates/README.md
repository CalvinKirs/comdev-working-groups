# Recommended response templates

Templates in this diretory are intended to provide a recommended
response to common questions that we receive on the dev@community
mailing list, while providing a little additional educational content
along with it.

Notes:

ALWAYS explicitly copy the sender, as they are almost certainly not
subscribed to the mailing list, which is the default Reply-To: address

ALWAYS also copy the mailing list, so that others will know that a
response has been sent, and we don't end up sending multiple copies of
the same message.

ALWAYS customize the message, including your own name, and the name of
the person to whom you are responding. These are not automated
responses, and communities are made of humans, not auto-responders.
