# Sharpeners use cases

Following are some example use cases for when a Sharpener might engage
a project community.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list --
just some examples.

## People-related problems

ASF communities are made of of people and people are prone to conflicts.
When conflicts among community members escalate and become personal or
when individuals consistently exhibit behaviors inconsistent with the ASF
Code of Conduct, the community faces a challenge.  The responsibility for
dealing the the challenge ultimately rests with the PMC.  Sharpeners may
have experience and certainly will have an outside perspective that can
be useful in addressing people-related problems in a community.

## Excessive influence by a subgroup (e.g. employees of a company) or individual (BDFL)

ASF communities are supposed to be open to substantive influence by all
community members.  Merit needs to be earned, but the ability to earn
merit and influence decisions needs to be open.  Communities that are
dominated by a subgroup or individual when there are others interested
in participating and being ignored are not healthy. 

## Barriers to contribution

Barriers to contribution can take many forms.  Some examples are 
ignoring contributors; excessively high bar for commit; excessive 
reliance on synchronous or in-person communications; planning sessions
that are not open to the community; language and communication styles
that alienate certain groups; special tools, employment status or
location needed - anything that makes it hard for an interested
community member to get their ideas into the project.

## Community lifecycle events

Communities can grow and contract very quickly at the ASF.  When a
project attracts the attention (and paid contributors) of one or more
large companies, a deluge of PRs and new potential committers can
arrive all at once.  Conversely, when an employer of a large number
of project committers decides to stop supporting the project, the
committer community can shrink quickly.  The same thing can happen
in the user community.  Projects can become wildly popular quickly
and equally quickly decline in use.  Project communities sometimes
have problems handling these changes.

## Community responsiveness

Sometimes ASF projects have a hard time keeping up with community input
in all of its forms - user lists, bug reports, PRs, new ideas.

## Project communications

There are no fixed rules for how projects need to communicate, but 
there needs to be enough easily accessible communication for users
and potential contributors to follow what is going on in the project,
to understand how to get the software and how to provide feedback.
Excessive dependency on synchronous and / or not publicly archived
communication is sometimes a problem that needs to be addressed.

## ASF policy compliance

The ASF has certain non-negotiable policies that communities are
expected to adhere to.  <insert brief list of links>

## Legal issues

We have very few lawyers among ASF communities, so when legal issues
arise, communities may need help getting connected to the right
resources.

## Infrastructure challenges

Most ASF projects have no problem getting the help that they need
from the ASF infrastructure team, but now and then they have special
needs or help making clear what their needs are.
