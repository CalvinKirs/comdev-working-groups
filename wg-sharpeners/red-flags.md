# Community Red Flags

We caution Sharpener participants not to look at this as a list of rules
to enforce. However, having an idea of what red flags we're looking for
in a project can be a helpful way to start looking for places to mentor,
and sharpen, our projects.

Remember, always, that you are a colleague, coming alongside a project,
not a policeman enforcing the rules.
