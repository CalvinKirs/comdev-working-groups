# Social Workgroup (Proposed)

To facilitate social gatherings wherever Apache contributors may be
present.

## Status

This WG is just an IDEA at this point. If you'd like to participate,
please come join the conversation.

## Who

Any Apache contributor may be a wg-social member. It's helpful if you
either travel to in-person events, or live in a place where Apache
contributors may gather, such as a large city, or a popular conference
destination.

## What

Arrange social gathering of Apache contributors. The exact parameters of
this are left up to the members of this WG, but intial suggestions might
be:

* Simply notifying attendees that other Apache contributors might be in
  the same location at the same time.
* Arranging a specific time/place for a gathering, whether for a meal,
  drinks, or informal gathering.
* Working with a sponsor to facilitate an actual sponsored event, and
  inviting Apache contributors to that event.
* Resurrect the party@apache.org mailing list to coordinate, and
  promote, these events. (Note that, for historical reasons,
  party@apache.org is a members-only private list. Do we need to create
  a new list for this that is more open?)

## Why

Building strong communities is easier in person. Facilitating informal
non-technical gatherings of Apache contributors, especially across
projects, builds strong bonds within the Foundation, and contributes to
important conversations that affect all of us.

## Values

* You will never spam the membership, or the projects, with excessive
  communication about gatherings. There's probably a lot of leeway to
  interpret this, but everyone knows spam when they see it.
* This is not a mechanism for companies to circumvent our trademark
  policies. Work with trademarks@ to ensure that you're not stepping on
  toes here.
* This is an unfunded, volunteer effort. You don't have access to ComDev
  budget for this, except with regard to foundation swag (stickers, for
  example) that ComDev chooses to provide.
* Gatherings must account for different tastes and preferences.
  Specifically, this means ensuring that gatherings happen at places
  where the dietary needs of all participants can be addressed, and that
  alcohol is never presented as a required part of the gathering. Other
  axes if inclusivity may be considered and codified.
