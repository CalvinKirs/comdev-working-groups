# Apache Community Development

This repo contains documentation and work product around the meta-task
of building communities at the Apache Software Foundation. Community
Development ("ComDev") is tasked with providing tools, processes, and
advice around community building. Apache projects (and, really, any open
source project!) is welcome to benefit from, and contribute to, this
effort, but are not obliged to do so.

## Other repos

This is one of several repos that ComDev maintains. Those repos can
mostly be found [here](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aapache+comdev&type=repositories). 
Most importantly, our website is [here](https://github.com/apache/comdev-site).

This one is not (yet) mirrored to Git, but probably will be some day,
once someone gets around to that. Meanwhile, it's [in
svn](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev).

## Working Groups

Some of the work of ComDev is subdivided into working groups, which you
will find in this repo. We are still in the process of booting up this
process, so everything is in flux. Come help.

We do not, at this time, draw any distinction between SIGs (Special
Interest Groups) and WGs (Working Groups). If you care about that kind
of thing, come help us define this.

## Contribute

The first step to contributing to this effort is to join the [ComDev
mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@community.apache.org) 
and introduce yourself.

## Inspiration

Some of the inspiration for this work comes from
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community), who have been
around a much shorter time than we have, and do a better job of this.
Thank you.
