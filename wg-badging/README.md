# Badging Workgroup (Proposed)

To provide a badging achievement system for ASF accomplishments.

## Status

This WG is just an IDEA at this point. If you'd like to participate,
please come join the conversation.

## What

Badging, like 
[https://badges.fedoraproject.org/](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/), 
is a way to celebrate
accomplishments within a project or community, across numerous different
topics. For example, we could give badges for first PR/patch accepted,
1000th email to members@, or 10th members meeting attended, first
release voted on, or, really, anything.

Badges incentivize people to get involved, as well as celebrating
milestones in view of the entire community. They are a fun, inexpensive
way to mark milestones, events, accomplishments, or victories.

Some badges might be automated, while others will need to be owned by
someone who can grant requested badges. This functionality is provided
by most badging platforms, and is not something we need to define.

## Values

1. It should be fun. The artwork should reflect that, it doesn’t need to be boring and corporate.
1. It should be easy. You should just start getting badges for the things you’re doing.
1. It should be collaborative. Beyond the badge code being open source, people should be able to suggest new badges
1. It must go beyond code. Code is easy, other contribution types are harder, but we should do everything we can.
1. We should have a way to award badges manually, so that we can
   celebrate things like event attendance, or other unique or one-time accomplishments.

## ToDo

* Research and choose a badging platform
* Build, Hosted or Paid service?
    * Is there a budget request associated with this?
* Identify people with design skills to make badge graphics
* Identify milestones we want to celebrate
* Promote to projects and identify project-specific badges
* Identify who will own badges that require some kind of
  verification/approval
