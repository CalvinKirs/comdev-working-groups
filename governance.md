This is a Work in Progress. Come help us improve it.

# Principles

The Apache community adheres to the following principles:
* Open: Apache software is open source. Apache communities believe in
  open development.
* Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
* Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. 

## Code of Conduct

The Apache ComDev community abides by the [Apache code of conduct]. We
welcome you to come work with us, but ask that you do so in polite,
respectful ways.

## Membership

At the moment, all ComDev working groups are voluntary and open. We
don't have any kind of formal membership process, although we may track
who is involved in a given effort at a given time, for the sake of
knowing who to talk to.
