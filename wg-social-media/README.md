# Social Media Working Group (Proposed)

Use social media to promote Apache communities

## What

Use the @apachecommunity Twitter account, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other
social media outlets to promote Apache communities.

Work with projects to better facilitate their own social media outlets,
and to share Foundation-wide messaging, where appropriate.

Work with MarkPub to ensure that all of the above is done correctly, and
on-message with the rest of the community.

## Who

The WG shall create membership criteria that ensure that you're enabling
people who can responsibly, consistently, positively and coherently be
spokespeople for the ASF. Possibly work with MarkPub to establish some
kind of guidelines or certification?
